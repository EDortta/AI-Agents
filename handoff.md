## [2026-05-04] WK-20260504-low-token-contract-v2 - review

- Status: ready-for-review
- Summary: Root `AGENTS.md` was reduced into a low-token dispatcher while install gates and detailed safety/workflow rules were preserved in focused docs. Installer now has `--upgrade` for safe existing-target migration.
- Next steps:
  - Review the docs diff.
  - Commit with subject `[WK-20260504-low-token-contract-v2] Reduce root contract token load` if accepted.
- Blockers/Risks:
  - No blocker. Main review risk is whether the compact root contract removed any rule that should remain always-loaded.
- Files changed:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/software-overview.md`
  - `docs/limits.md`
  - `docs/agents/_shared.md`
  - `docs/agents/programmer.md`
  - `docs/agents/security.md`
  - `docs/agents/privacy-compliance.md`
  - `docs/workflows/session-restore.md`
  - `docs/workflows/session-close.md`
  - `docs/issues/001-low-token-contract-v2-[review]/`
  - `scripts/install-agents-kit.sh`
  - `README.md`
  - `README-ptbr.md`
  - `README-es.md`
- Checks/Tests executed:
  - `rg -n "project_context_ready|limits_ready|..." .` -> readiness and stale-reference scan completed
  - `rg -n "## [0-9]+\\. (...old section names...)" docs AGENTS.md` -> no stale old section references
  - `wc -l AGENTS.md docs/agents/programmer.md docs/workflows/session-restore.md docs/workflows/session-close.md` -> root contract is 182 lines
  - `bash -n scripts/install-agents-kit.sh` -> passed
  - fresh install smoke test in temp target -> exited 30 and reset target readiness flags to `no`
  - upgrade smoke test in temp target -> preserved project-local state and deleted stale managed files
  - `git diff --check` -> passed
- Related commits:
  - planned: `[WK-20260504-low-token-contract-v2] Reduce root contract token load`
- Suggested restart prompt:
  - "Continue work_id WK-20260504-low-token-contract-v2. Read docs/issues/001-low-token-contract-v2-[review]/RESUME.md first."
